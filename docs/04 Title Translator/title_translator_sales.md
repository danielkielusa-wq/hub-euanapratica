## What Triggers Their Need

**Trigger Event 1: Job Application Silence**
They've applied to 50+ jobs but getting zero responses. They suspect their resume isn't passing ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). A wrong job title is one common reason resumes get filtered out.

**Trigger Event 2: LinkedIn Profile Optimization**
They're updating their LinkedIn to attract US recruiters. They realize their Brazilian title doesn't translate cleanly. Googling gives conflicting answers.

**Trigger Event 3: Salary Negotiation**
They got an offer but don't know if the salary is fair. They need to understand the market rate for their US-equivalent title.

**Trigger Event 4: Career Level Confusion**
They're unsure if they should apply for "mid-level" or "senior" roles in the US. Their Brazilian title ("Coordenador") could map to either depending on responsibilities.

**Trigger Event 5: Immigration/Visa Applications**
Filling out visa paperwork (H1B, O-1, etc.) that requires a US job title. They need to be accurate to match job offer letters.

**Sales Signal:** If a prospect mentions any of these situations, Title Translator is a direct solution.

## Common Objections & How to Handle Them

### Objection 1: "I can just use ChatGPT for free."

**Response:**
"Great point—ChatGPT can help. But here's the difference: ChatGPT gives you a generic answer based on the title alone. We analyze your specific responsibilities, team size, years of experience, and functional area to give you context-aware recommendations. Plus, you get salary ranges, example companies, and job description snippets—not just a title. It's like asking ChatGPT vs. asking a career coach who specializes in Brazilian→US transitions."

**Close:** "Try your 1 free translation and compare it to ChatGPT. You'll see the difference."

---

### Objection 2: "My title is simple—I don't need a tool for this."

**Response:**
"That's what most people think! But here's the thing: even 'simple' titles like 'Analista' can map to 5+ different US titles depending on your seniority and responsibilities. Are you an Analyst, Associate, Specialist, Consultant, or Coordinator? Each one signals a different level and comes with a different salary range. The tool eliminates the guesswork."

**Example:** "One user thought 'Gerente de Vendas' was obviously 'Sales Manager.' Turns out, based on their team size (2 people) and revenue responsibility, they were actually a 'Sales Team Lead'—and the salary difference is $15k/year."

**Close:** "Use your free credit just to confirm. Even if you're 90% sure, it's worth validating."

---

### Objection 3: "I only need to translate one title—why would I upgrade to Pro?"

**Response:**
"Most people think that too at first! But here's what happens: you translate your current title, then you realize you need to translate your LAST two jobs for your resume. Then you want to translate your *actual* responsibilities vs. your official title to see if there's a better match. Then you're updating your LinkedIn headline and want to test a variation. Before you know it, you've used 5-6 credits."

**Plus:** "Pro users also get 10 ResumePass credits per month—so you can analyze your resume multiple times as you iterate. It's about having the flexibility to experiment until your profile is perfect."

**Close:** "Start with Basic, use your free credit, and if you find yourself wanting more, Pro is just [price]/month and resets every 30 days."

---

### Objection 4: "The salary ranges are probably inaccurate."

**Response:**
"I get it—salary data can be hit or miss. Our AI pulls from real job market data (same sources as Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, Levels.fyi), but here's the key: we give you a RANGE, not a single number. That range accounts for company size, location, and experience level. It's a starting point for your research, not a guarantee."

**Transparency:** "Think of it like Zillow for houses—the 'Zestimate' isn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than guessing. Same here."

**Close:** "You'll see the range in your results. Cross-check it with Glassdoor if you want, but most users find it aligns well with what they see in job postings."

---

### Objection 5: "What if the AI gives me the wrong title and I use it on my resume?"

**Response:**
"Good question—you're right to be cautious. Here's how to think about it: the AI gives you THREE options, ranked by confidence, plus detailed reasoning. You're not blindly trusting one answer—you're making an informed decision based on multiple data points."

**Recommendation:** "Use the recommended title, but also read the explanations for the alternatives. If something doesn't feel right (e.g., the responsibilities don't match), choose the second option. The tool empowers you to make the call, it doesn't make the call for you."

**Safety Net:** "Plus, you can post your results in the EUA na Prática community and get feedback from others who've been through the process. It's AI + human validation."

**Close:** "The AI has a 9.2/10 average confidence score—it's very accurate. But you always have final say."

---

### Objection 6: "I'm not ready to apply for jobs yet—I'm still learning English."

**Response:**
"Perfect—actually, NOW is the best time to use Title Translator. Here's why: it takes months to optimize your LinkedIn and resume. If you wait until you're 'ready,' you'll be scrambling to figure out your title at the last minute. Get it right now, update your profile, and let recruiters start finding you organically while you're still preparing."

**Plus:** "The tool also shows you what skills and experience levels are expected for each US title. That helps you understand what gaps you need to fill before you start applying."

**Close:** "Think of it as part of your preparation phase, not something you do at the last second."

**Differentiator 1: Context-Aware Analysis**
We don't just translate words. We analyze responsibilities, team size, budget ownership, and reporting structure to determine the RIGHT title for your specific situation.

You don't just get a title—you get salary ranges (USD), example companies, and real job description snippets so you can see how it's used in the wild.

**Differentiator 3: Three Options, Not One**
We give you the top recommendation PLUS two alternatives, so you can choose based on your target companies or seniority goals.

This isn't a generic translation tool. It's trained specifically on the Brazilian job market and US corporate culture. We understand both sides of the equation.

Title Translator is part of the EUA na Prática platform, which includes resume analysis, job marketplace, community, and mentorship—all working together to get you hired.

**Competitive Summary:**
- **vs. Google/Reddit:** Faster (10 seconds vs. hours), more accurate (context-aware vs. generic)
- **vs. ChatGPT:** More data (salary + companies), specialized training (BR→US)
- **vs. Career Coaches:** Cheaper ($0-49/month vs. $200-500/session), instant (vs. requires scheduling)
- **vs. Resume Services:** Self-service (vs. wait days), repeatable (10+ uses vs. one-time)

## Sales Qualifying Questions

**Use these to determine if Title Translator is the right fit:**

1. **"Are you currently applying to US jobs, or are you still in the research phase?"**
   - If actively applying → High urgency, immediate need
   - If researching → Lower urgency, but good lead for nurturing

2. **"Have you updated your LinkedIn profile for US recruiters yet?"**
   - If no → Title Translator is a natural first step
   - If yes → Ask what title they used, validate if it's correct

3. **"How many different job titles have you held in your career?"**
   - If 1 → Basic plan (1 credit) is fine
   - If 3+ → Pro plan (10 credits) is better fit

4. **"Have you gotten recruiter responses on LinkedIn or job applications?"**
   - If no responses → Might be title mismatch, pitch Title Translator
   - If getting responses → Less urgent, but still useful for salary negotiation

5. **"Do you know what salary range to expect for your experience level in the US?"**
   - If no → Title Translator provides this data automatically
   - If yes → Ask what source they used, compare to our AI data

## Objection Pre-Emption (Address Before They Ask)

**In your pitch, proactively say:**

"Before you ask—yes, you could use ChatGPT for free, but our AI is trained specifically on Brazilian→US career transitions and gives you salary data + company examples that generic AI doesn't provide."

"And I know what you're thinking—'I only need to translate one title.' Most users think that too, then realize they need to translate past roles for their resume, test variations for LinkedIn, etc. That's why Pro gives you 10 credits per month instead of just one."

"Also, Title Translator is just one part of the platform. The real value is combining it with ResumePass (AI resume analysis), Prime Jobs (curated job board), and the Community (peer support). It's not a standalone tool—it's part of an ecosystem that gets you hired faster."

## Closing Lines That Work

**Soft Close (Low Pressure):**
"Why don't you try your 1 free translation and see if the results are useful? No credit card needed, takes 10 seconds. If you like it, you can always upgrade to Pro later."

**Urgency Close (For Prospects Who Are Hesitating):**
"Job search is competitive right now. Every day you have the wrong title on LinkedIn is a day recruiters aren't finding you. Let's get this fixed today—it literally takes 10 seconds."

**Value-Stack Close (For Upgrade Conversations):**

## Red Flags (When NOT to Sell Title Translator)

**Don't Pitch If:**
1. **They're not targeting the US job market** (tool is US-specific, won't help for Europe/Canada/Australia)
2. **They have no current job/experience** (students, new grads with no title to translate)
3. **They're looking for freelance/gig work** (job titles matter less in freelancing)
4. **They're applying to Brazilian companies with US offices** (might not need full title translation)
5. **They're in a very niche field** (AI may not have good data for hyper-specialized roles like "Actuarial Science Specialist in Reinsurance")

**Instead, route them to:**
- **Sessão de Direção ROTA EUA™** (1:1 career strategy if they need more than a tool)
- **Community** (free peer support if they're just exploring)
- **ResumePass** (if their main issue is resume quality, not title)

---

## Final Sales Tip

**Title Translator sells itself when you show it, not tell it.**

In sales calls, do a LIVE DEMO:
1. Ask for their current Brazilian title
2. Ask 1-2 quick questions (area, years of experience)
3. Run the translation live on screen-share
4. Watch their reaction when they see the salary range and recommended title
5. Close while they're excited

**Script:** "Let's do this live right now. What's your current title in Brazil? ... Great, and how many years of experience? ... Okay, let me run this through the AI. [10 seconds] ... Here's what it says: your recommended US title is [X], with a salary range of $[Y]-$[Z]. Does that feel accurate based on your responsibilities?"

**9 times out of 10, they'll say:** "Wow, that's exactly what I needed. How do I sign up?"

**That's when you close.**
