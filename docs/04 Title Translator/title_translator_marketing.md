## What Title Translator Does

Title Translator (branded as "Experience Translator" in the UI) is an AI-powered tool that solves a critical pain point for Brazilian professionals applying to US jobs: **job title mismatch**.

In Brazil, a "Coordenador de TI" might manage 5 developers and handle technical architecture. In the USA, that same role could be called "IT Team Lead," "Engineering Manager," or "Technical Lead" depending on company culture and seniority norms. Using the wrong title on a resume or LinkedIn profile means recruiters won't find you, and when they do, they'll misunderstand your level of responsibility.

Title Translator analyzes your Brazilian title, work responsibilities, and experience level, then gives you three ranked US title alternatives with:
- **Confidence scores** (how well this title matches your profile)
- **Salary ranges** in USD (what you should expect to earn)
- **Example companies** that use this exact title
- **Sample job description snippets** (so you can see how it's used in real postings)

It tells you which title to use and explains why it's the best fit for your specific situation.

   We give you the top recommendation PLUS two alternatives, so you can choose the best fit based on your target companies or seniority goals.

## Main User Journey

**Stage 1: Discovery**
Maria is a 32-year-old "Coordenadora de Marketing Digital" in São Paulo with 6 years of experience. She's been researching how to move to the USA and joined the EUA na Prática community. She sees people discussing LinkedIn profile optimization and someone mentions "make sure your title translates correctly."

Maria realizes she's been using "Digital Marketing Coordinator" on her LinkedIn, but she's not sure if that's accurate. She manages 3 people and owns campaign strategy for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company. Is "Coordinator" too junior?

**Stage 2: Activation**
She logs into her EUA na Prática dashboard and sees "Experience Translator" in the navigation with a "Beta Tool" badge. Curious, she clicks in.

The interface is clean and simple. A form asks for:
- Her current title in Brazil (required)
- Her functional area (dropdown: Marketing)
- Her main responsibilities (optional textarea)
- Years of experience (optional number)

She fills it out:
- Title: "Coordenadora de Marketing Digital"
- Area: Marketing
- Responsibilities: "Lidero equipe de 3 profissionais, planejo campanhas B2B, gerencio orçamento de R$50k/mês, reporto direto ao CMO"
- Years: 6

She clicks "Traduzir Título (1 Crédito)" and waits 8 seconds.

**Stage 3: Insight**
The results appear. The top recommendation is displayed in a hero section with a dark gradient background:

**Recommended:** "Digital Marketing Manager"

**Why:** "Based on your team leadership (3 direct reports), budget ownership, and direct C-suite reporting, 'Manager' is the appropriate US title. 'Coordinator' in the US typically refers to individual contributors without direct reports."

**Salary Range:** $85,000 - $115,000/year

**Confidence:** 9.2/10

**Example Companies:** HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe, Shopify, Zendesk

Below, she sees two alternative options:
- "Digital Marketing Team Lead" (8.5/10 confidence, $75k-$95k)
- "Senior Digital Marketing Specialist" (7.8/10 confidence, $70k-$90k)

Each alternative includes a snippet from a real job description showing how the title is used.

**Stage 4: Action**
Maria copies "Digital Marketing Manager" to her clipboard. She immediately updates her LinkedIn headline and resume. She feels confident she's now positioned correctly for US recruiters searching for mid-level marketing managers.

She also bookmarks the salary range ($85k-$115k) to use in future negotiations. This is her first concrete data point for what she should expect to earn.

**Stage 5: Advocacy**
Maria screenshots her results and posts in the EUA na Prática community: "Gente, usei o Title Translator e descobri que eu deveria estar me posicionando como Manager, não Coordinator! 🤯 Já mudei meu LinkedIn. Ferramenta essencial!"

Three other members immediately go try it. One upgrades to Pro because they're translating multiple titles across their career history (10 credits needed).

## Final Note

Title Translator is a **value multiplier** rather than a standalone product. It makes the entire EUA na Prática platform stickier by solving a specific, high-pain problem quickly and confidently. Market it as the "missing piece" in the job search puzzle—because even a perfect resume won't help if your title is wrong.

Focus on **before/after transformations** in all marketing: show the Brazilian title, show the US equivalent, show the salary difference. This creates immediate visual impact and demonstrates tangible value.

The "Beta" label is both a shield (manage expectations) and a draw (exclusive early access). Consider removing it once we have 1,000+ translations logged and can show social proof at scale.
