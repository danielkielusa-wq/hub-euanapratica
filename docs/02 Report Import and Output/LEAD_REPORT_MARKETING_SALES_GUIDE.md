## 1. What is the Lead Diagnostic System?

### 1.1 Purpose

The Lead Diagnostic System **automatically qualifies and nurtures leads** who submit our career assessment form. It's like having an AI career consultant that works 24/7, analyzing every lead's profile and giving them a personalized roadmap + product recommendation.

**What it replaces:**
- ❌ Manual lead review (2-3 hours per lead)
- ❌ Generic email templates
- ❌ Guesswork about which product to offer
- ❌ Subjective "gut feel" qualification

**What it delivers:**
- ✅ Instant personalized 2,500-word report (in 30 seconds)
- ✅ Objective 0-100 readiness score
- ✅ AI-recommended product based on profile + budget
- ✅ Actionable next steps (30-day, 90-day, 6-month plans)

### 1.2 Business Impact

**For Marketing:**
- Track which campaigns bring qualified leads (vs just volume)
- See which lead sources have highest readiness scores
- Optimize ad spend based on score distribution by channel

**For Sales:**
- Know which leads to prioritize (hot vs warm vs cold)
- Understand lead's profile before first call
- Use report data to personalize pitch
- Reduce time spent qualifying unready leads

## 2. How It Works (Simplified)

### 2.1 The Journey (Customer Perspective)

```
1. Lead clicks ad/post → Lands on euanapratica.com
   ↓
2. Fills out 17-question assessment form (~3-5 minutes)
   Questions: English level, experience, visa status, timeline, budget, etc.
   ↓
3. Submits form → Instant redirect to "Gerando seu relatório..." loading page
   ↓
4. AI generates personalized report (~30 seconds)
   - Calculates 0-100 readiness score
   - Identifies critical barriers (English? Visa? Experience?)
   - Creates action plans (30d, 90d, 6m)
   - Recommends best product from our catalog
   ↓
5. Lead sees beautiful web report with:
   - Their score + phase (e.g., "54/100 - Desenvolvimento")
   - Personalized narrative ("João, sua maior força é...")
   - Recommended product with CTA button
   ↓
6. Lead clicks CTA → Goes to checkout/booking page
```
