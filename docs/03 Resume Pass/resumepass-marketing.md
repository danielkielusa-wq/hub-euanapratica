# ResumePass AI — Product & Positioning Brief

**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Audience:** Marketing Team

---

## What It Does

ResumePass AI tells Brazilian professionals whether their resume will pass US hiring systems — and exactly how to fix it if it won't. Users upload their resume, paste a US job description, and get an instant compatibility report showing their ATS score, keyword gaps, cultural translation issues, market salary estimate, and step-by-step improvement suggestions.

Think of it as a bridge between Brazilian resume standards and American hiring expectations, powered by AI.

## The Pain Point

Brazilian professionals applying to US jobs face an invisible barrier: most resumes are automatically rejected by ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) before a human ever reads them. Why?

- **Format incompatibility** — Brazilian resumes use different layouts, fonts, and structures that ATS software can't parse
- **Keyword gaps** — US job descriptions use specific technical terms and action verbs that Brazilian resumes often miss
- **Cultural translation** — A "Coordenador de TI" isn't obviously a "Senior IT Manager" to an American recruiter
- **Length issues** — Brazilian resumes tend to be longer and more detailed than the US 1-page standard

The frustrating part? Applicants have no idea why they're being rejected. They just get silence. No feedback. No second chance.

## Target User Profile

**Primary persona: The Ambitious Tech Professional**

- Age 28-40, 5-10 years experience in tech or engineering
- Based in Brazil, dreaming of US remote work or relocation
- Fluent in English but unfamiliar with US resume norms
- Has applied to 20+ US jobs with minimal response
- Frustrated, confused, starting to doubt their qualifications
- Willing to invest in tools that give them a competitive edge

**What they struggle with:**
- "I'm qualified, so why aren't they even interviewing me?"
- "How do I know if my resume is formatted correctly?"
- "What keywords do I actually need to include?"
- "Is my job title even translating correctly?"

**What they want:**
- Concrete, actionable feedback (not vague advice)
- Confidence that their resume will at least be read
- Understanding of the "hidden rules" of US hiring
- A competitive edge over other international applicants

**⚠️ Inferred — needs verification:** Secondary personas could include career changers, recent bootcamp grads, and non-tech professionals (if product expands beyond tech roles).

## Core Value Proposition

**"Get your resume past the robots and in front of humans."**

We decode the ATS black box. Instead of guessing what's wrong, users get a detailed diagnostic showing exactly where their resume fails and a step-by-step blueprint to fix it — based on real US hiring standards, not generic resume advice.

**Key differentiators:**

1. **Brazil → US cultural bridge** — We don't just check grammar, we translate Brazilian professional context into American equivalents (job titles, achievement framing, market positioning)

2. **Job-specific analysis** — Not a generic resume checker. Analysis is tailored to the exact job description they're applying to, showing keyword match rate and what's missing.

3. **Before/after improvements** — Not just "add more action verbs" — we show their actual resume text next to improved versions ready to copy-paste.

4. **Interview preparation included** (Pro/VIP) — Beyond just fixing the resume, we predict likely interview questions based on their profile and the job description.

5. **Market salary context** — Shows what their experience is worth in the US job market, helping them negotiate with confidence.

**⚠️ Inferred — needs verification:** Competitive alternatives would include Jobscan (US-focused, no cultural bridge), Resume Worded (generic scoring), manual resume writers (expensive, slow).

## Main User Journey (The Story)

**Meet Ana.**

Ana is a 32-year-old software engineer in São Paulo. She's been applying to US remote jobs for 6 months. 50+ applications. Zero interviews. She's bilingual, experienced, and increasingly convinced that American companies just don't hire Brazilians.

**The breaking point:**
A recruiter finally responds — to tell her that her resume "didn't meet minimum qualifications" for a mid-level role she's over-qualified for. She knows something is broken, but not what.

**Discovery:**
Ana searches "why aren't US companies responding to my resume" and finds an article about ATS rejection rates for international applicants. The article mentions ResumePass.

**First experience (Free tier):**
She uploads her resume and pastes a job description from her dream company. 30 seconds later: compatibility score of 34%. Ouch. The breakdown shows:

- ATS format: 42/100 — her two-column layout can't be parsed
- Keywords: 3 out of 12 required terms present
- Job title translation: "Engenheira de Software Sênior" → should be "Senior Software Engineer" in her headline
- Market value: $95k-$125k/year (she was going to ask for $70k)

The free tier shows her the diagnosis. She knows what's wrong now. But the "how to fix it" sections are locked behind upgrade.

**Conversion moment:**
Ana upgrades to Pro ($X/month) to see the improvement suggestions. She gets 5 specific before/after examples:

- Original bullet: "Responsible for developing payment system features"
- Improved: "Architected payment gateway processing 50K+ daily transactions, reducing checkout errors by 23%"

Each improvement is tagged (QUANTIFICATION, IMPACT, POWER VERB) so she understands the pattern.

**Outcome:**
Ana rewrites her resume using the suggestions. She reformats it to single-column. She adds the missing keywords naturally into her bullets. She updates her LinkedIn headline to "Senior Software Engineer | Fintech | React/Node.js" as recommended.

Two weeks later: first interview request. One month later: second round at 3 companies.

**The hook:**
Ana shares her results in a Brazilian expat Facebook group. "If you're applying to US jobs and getting ghosted, run your resume through ResumePass first — it literally shows you what ATS bots see." Five friends sign up.

## Social Proof & Virality Hooks

**Current state (from codebase review):**

The product has built-in sharing potential but no explicit viral features implemented:

- **Report saving** — Users can access their analysis history, implying they might return multiple times
- **Upgrade prompts** — Free tier experience is designed to show value (diagnosis) then lock actionable fixes, creating conversion pressure
- **PDF export** — Allows users to share reports with career coaches, friends, or mentors

**⚠️ Inferred — needs verification:** No referral program, social sharing buttons, or "compared to other candidates" benchmarking found in the codebase.

**Organic sharing likely happens via:**
- Brazilian expat communities (Facebook groups, WhatsApp, Discord servers)
- LinkedIn posts celebrating first interviews/job offers after using the tool
- Word-of-mouth among bootcamp cohorts and tech meetup attendees

**Marketing opportunity:** Add "Your resume scored higher than X% of candidates for this role" or "Share your improvement progress" features to encourage organic sharing.

## Tone & Language

**From UI copy analysis:**

The product speaks to users in **Portuguese (Brazilian)** with a professional but encouraging tone. Key phrases include:

- "Seu currículo obteve X% de compatibilidade" (Your resume scored X% compatibility)
- Error messages are empathetic: "Não foi possível processar seu currículo. Tente novamente." (We couldn't process your resume. Try again.)
- Plan upgrade CTAs are direct but not pushy: "Este recurso está disponível nos planos Pro e VIP. Faça upgrade para desbloquear." (This feature is available on Pro and VIP plans. Upgrade to unlock.)

**Tone characteristics:**

- **Bilingual-aware** — Reports mix Portuguese explanations with English resume examples (reflects reality of applying to US jobs while thinking in Portuguese)
- **Data-driven** — Uses specific percentages, scores, and counts rather than vague assessments
- **Action-oriented** — Every insight comes with a "what to do about it" implication
- **Non-judgmental** — Frames issues as system incompatibility, not user inadequacy

**Marketing voice recommendation:**

Speak to the frustration and confusion, not the failure. Messaging should acknowledge "the system is unfair and opaque" while positioning the product as the decoder ring that levels the playing field.

Avoid: "Fix your bad resume"
Use: "Bridge the gap between your qualifications and how US systems read them"

## Positioning Recommendations

**Category:** Resume optimization for international job seekers (specifically Brazil → US)

**Not:** Generic resume checker, grammar tool, or career coaching

**Frame the problem as:** System incompatibility, not user incompetence. "ATS robots don't understand Brazilian resumes" resonates better than "your resume needs work."

**Competitive positioning:**

| Alternative | Why we're different |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Hiring a resume writer ($200-500) | Instant results, test unlimited versions, understand the why |
| Jobscan (US tool) | We translate Brazilian context, not just check keywords |
| Generic AI resume tools | Job-specific analysis + cultural bridge, not template filling |
| Doing it manually | You can't see what ATS sees — we can |

**Campaign angle ideas:**

1. **"Why US companies aren't responding"** — Educational content targeting the "ghosted applicant" pain point
2. **"Your resume in ATS vision"** — Show the before/after of how parsing errors destroy resumes
3. **"$70k vs $120k"** — Market value insights that show underselling is common among international applicants
4. **"Interview in 2 weeks"** — Results-driven testimonials (if available)

**⚠️ Inferred — needs verification:** Conversion funnel likely optimized for "try free → see diagnosis → frustrated by locked improvements → upgrade to fix." Marketing should drive top-of-funnel awareness of ATS rejection problem.

## Questions for Product Team

1. **Conversion data:** What % of free tier users upgrade after seeing locked features?
2. **Usage patterns:** Are Pro users analyzing different versions of one resume, or different resumes for different jobs?
3. **Success metrics:** Do we have any data on interview rates before/after using ResumePass?
4. **Churn triggers:** Are users staying subscribed or doing one month then canceling?
