# ResumePass AI — Sales Enablement Brief

**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Audience:** Sales Team

---

## Elevator Pitch

ResumePass AI shows Brazilian professionals why their resume is being auto-rejected by US hiring systems and gives them a step-by-step blueprint to fix it — in under 60 seconds.

**One-sentence version:**
"We decode ATS rejection for international job seekers and turn ghosted applications into interview invitations."

---

## Ideal Customer Profile

### **Individual Contributors (Primary Target)**

**Who they are:**
- Brazilian tech professionals with 3-10 years experience
- Currently employed but seeking US remote work or relocation
- Bilingual (Portuguese/English), often with US-equivalent skills but not US resume standards
- Age 25-40, salary range $30k-$80k in Brazil, targeting $80k-$150k US roles

**Buying triggers:**
- Just got rejected from a role they know they're qualified for
- Applied to 20+ US jobs with zero responses
- Friend or colleague got a US job and they want to know how
- About to invest in expensive resume writing services (our product is 1/10th the cost)
- Preparing for a big career move (bootcamp graduation, visa opportunity, family relocation)

**Pain intensity:** High. They're stuck between "I know I'm good enough" and "nobody will even interview me." The emotional driver is frustration + confusion, not just career ambition.

### **B2B Opportunities (Secondary/Future)**

**⚠️ Inferred — needs verification:** VIP tier (999 analyses/month) suggests potential for:

- Career coaching firms serving Brazilian → US job seekers
- Immigration consultancies offering employment-based visa services
- Tech bootcamps with international job placement programs
- University career centers with US-focused programs

**Buying trigger for B2B:**
Service providers need to differentiate their offering and show tangible results. "We use ResumePass AI to diagnose and fix ATS issues" becomes a service feature they can promote.

## Key Benefits (Outcomes, Not Features)

### 1. **Stop Getting Ghosted**
**Not:** "We analyze your resume with AI"
**Instead:** "Find out why 90% of your applications disappear into the void — and fix it before your next application"

**Sales conversation:**
"Have you been applying to US jobs and hearing nothing back? That's not rejection — that's ATS auto-filtering before humans see your resume. We show you exactly what the robots see and where you're failing their checks."

### 2. **Save 10-20 Hours of Guessing**
**Not:** "We provide improvement suggestions"
**Instead:** "Get specific before/after rewrites of your actual resume bullets — copy, paste, apply"

**Sales conversation:**
"Instead of Googling 'how to write a US resume' and reading 47 contradictory blog posts, you get instant, job-specific feedback. Upload your resume for a Software Engineer role? You get Software Engineer-specific improvements. No generic templates."

### 3. **Know Your Worth in the US Market**
**Not:** "We estimate market salary"
**Instead:** "Stop underselling yourself — see what your experience actually commands in the US before negotiating"

**Sales conversation:**
"Most Brazilian professionals applying to US jobs underestimate their market value by 30-40%. We show you the actual salary range for your role and experience level so you don't accidentally ask for $70k when the market pays $120k."

### 4. **Understand Cultural Translation Gaps**
**Not:** "We translate job titles"
**Instead:** "Bridge the gap between what your title means in Brazil vs. what US recruiters understand"

**Sales conversation:**
"Your Brazilian title might be 'Analista de Sistemas Sênior' but US recruiters are searching for 'Senior Systems Analyst' or 'Software Engineer.' We tell you exactly what to put in your headline and LinkedIn so you show up in their searches."

### 5. **Get Interview-Ready Fast**
**Not:** "We provide interview questions" (Pro/VIP only)
**Instead:** "Know what they'll ask and how to answer before you even apply"

**Sales conversation:**
"With Pro, you get 3-5 likely interview questions tailored to the job description plus context tips in Portuguese. Walk into interviews prepared, not scrambling."

## Common Objections & Responses

### **"I can just Google how to write a US resume."**

**Response:**
"You absolutely can — and you'll find 1,000 articles with contradictory advice. Here's the difference: we analyze YOUR resume against a SPECIFIC job description and show you exactly what's missing. It's not generic tips, it's 'your ATS score is 34% because you're missing these 9 keywords and your format can't be parsed.' You can't get that from a blog post."

**Proof point:** Show them the metrics breakdown (8/12 keywords matched, ATS format score, etc.)

---

### **"Resume writers only cost $200-300."**

**Response:**
"That's true for a one-time rewrite. But what happens when you apply to a different type of role next month? You pay another $200. With ResumePass Pro, you can test unlimited variations, apply to different job types, and iterate based on real feedback — all for less than the cost of one professional rewrite."

**Plus:** "And resume writers won't show you the data. You won't know if your ATS score is 45% or 85%. You're trusting their judgment. We show you the numbers."

---

### **"I've already applied to 50 jobs — isn't it too late?"**

**Response:**
"Actually, now is the perfect time. If you've been getting ghosted, that means your resume has a systemic problem — and fixing it before your next 50 applications is the difference between more silence and interview invitations. Plus, you can use ResumePass to analyze which of your saved job descriptions has the best keyword match with your optimized resume."

**Reframe:** Past applications are sunk cost. Future applications are the opportunity.

---

### **"Why should I trust an AI to judge my resume?"**

**Response:**
"Fair question. Here's the thing: ATS systems — the robots that are currently rejecting you — are also AI. They're parsing your resume with algorithms. What we do is reverse-engineer what those algorithms are looking for. Keyword density, format compatibility, action verb patterns — these are measurable things, not subjective opinions."

**Plus:** "The AI isn't replacing human judgment — it's showing you what the robots see before humans get a chance to judge. You're already being evaluated by AI. We just let you see the scorecard."

---

### **"I don't want to pay monthly — I just need it once."**

**Response:**
"That's what the free tier is for. You get 1 analysis per month to see if there's a problem. If you need more than that — say you're actively job hunting and applying to 5-10 roles — Pro makes sense for a month or two while you're in application mode. Cancel anytime."

**Alternative:** "Think of it like this: if one interview from a $100k+ job comes from fixing your resume, the ROI is 100x. Even one month of Pro pays for itself if it gets you one conversation you wouldn't have had otherwise."

---

### **"What if the job doesn't require ATS? What if a human reads it first?"**

**Response:**
"Great question. Here's the reality: 99% of companies with more than 50 employees use ATS. Even startups often use tools like Lever, Greenhouse, or Ashby. And even if a human reads it first, they're scanning for the same signals — keywords, quantified achievements, clear job title matches. ResumePass optimizes for both robots AND humans."

**Plus:** "The cultural bridge piece (Brazilian title → US equivalent) is valuable even if there's no ATS. A recruiter won't know what 'Coordenador de TI' means, but they'll understand 'IT Manager.'"

## What Makes Us Different

### **vs. Doing It Manually**
You can't see what ATS bots see. We can. You're guessing. We're measuring.

### **vs. Jobscan (US competitor)**
Jobscan assumes you already understand US resume norms. We translate Brazilian professional context into American equivalents. Job title translation, market salary context, cultural framing — they don't do that.

### **vs. Resume Writers**
They give you one version. We let you test unlimited versions. They cost $200-500. We cost a fraction. They take 3-5 days. We take 60 seconds.

### **vs. Generic AI Tools (ChatGPT, Jasper, etc.)**
Generic tools don't have the structured output we provide. They won't give you a 0-100 ATS score, keyword match ratio, or before/after improvements tagged by type. They're creative writing tools, not diagnostic tools.

## Sales Process Recommendations

### **Step 1: Qualify**
- Are they actively applying to US jobs? (If not, timing is off)
- Have they experienced rejection/silence? (If not, no pain point)
- Are they willing to invest in career tools? (If not, free tier only)

### **Step 2: Demo the Problem**
- Show them a sample analysis with low score (30-40%)
- Walk through the breakdown: "See these 9 missing keywords? That's why you're being filtered out."
- Highlight one locked feature: "This is where we'd show you how to fix it — but that's Pro only."

### **Step 3: Frame the ROI**
- "If one interview leads to a $100k job, what's the value of knowing your resume works before you apply?"
- "Resume writers charge $200-300 for one version. This is $X/month for unlimited testing."

### **Step 4: Trial Close**
- "Want to run your actual resume through and see your real score?"
- "Which of these job descriptions are you most excited about? Let's analyze that one first."

### **Step 5: Close**
- Free tier: "Sign up with email, upload, and you'll see your score in 60 seconds."
- Pro upgrade: "Unlock the improvements section right now and start editing your resume today."

## Red Flags (Disqualify Gracefully)

- **"I don't have a resume yet"** → Send them to a resume template resource first
- **"I'm not applying to US jobs, just curious"** → Free tier is fine, don't push Pro
- **"I want you to write my resume for me"** → We're a diagnostic tool, not a writing service (position as complementary to resume writers if needed)

## Questions to Ask Product/Marketing

1. What's the actual pricing for Pro and VIP tiers?
2. Do we have any testimonials or case studies with measurable outcomes (interview rate increase, salary negotiation wins)?
3. What's the average time from free signup to Pro upgrade?
4. Are there any partnerships with bootcamps or career coaching firms we can leverage for B2B sales?
5. What's the churn rate on Pro subscriptions — are users staying long-term or using it for 1-2 months during active job search?
